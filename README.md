# ðŸ“Š Three Generations Seeking Romance: Regression and Classification Analysis

## 1. Introduction

- **Topic**: Online dating apps assist users in finding romantic relationships while enabling the prediction of age and generation by analyzing user profiles. This study aims to predict age and generation based on these profiles.
- **Dataset**: The analysis will use anonymized data from over 60,000 users from OkCupid to predict age and generation. Machine learning techniques will be employed to forecast user age and generation.

## 2. Objectives

- **Age Prediction (Regression)**: Predict the age of users based on profile data.
- **Generation Prediction (Classification)**: Determine which generation users belong to (Millennial, Gen X, Boomer) using their profile data.

## 3. Methodology

### For Age Prediction (Regression):

- **Model Selection**: Regression models such as Gradient Boosting and KNeighborsRegressor can be used.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Model performance is evaluated using metrics like R^2 score, RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
- **Scaling**: Scaling of data is crucial to enhance model performance.

### For Generation Prediction (Classification):

- **Model Selection**: Classification models such as KNeighborsClassifier and Deep Learning models can be utilized.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Model performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
- **Data Processing**: Conversion of categorical data to numerical values is necessary for efficient model operation.

## 4. Results and Evaluation

- **Age Prediction Results**: The prediction results of the models are compared. The success of the model is assessed using R^2 score, RMSE, and MAE. For example, differences between results from Gradient Boosting and KNeighborsRegressor are analyzed.

- **Generation Prediction Results**: The accuracy and other metrics of the classification model are evaluated. The performance of KNeighborsClassifier and Deep Learning models is compared.

## 5. Visualization

- **Age Distribution**: Relationships between predicted and actual age values are visualized using scatter plots.
- **Confusion Matrix**: The performance of generation predictions is visualized using a confusion matrix.

## 6. Conclusion and Recommendations

- **Results**: The performance of models is analyzed to determine which model provides better results. The success of regression models for age prediction and classification models for generation prediction is evaluated.

ðŸŽ¯ **Future Recommendations**: To improve model performance, additional data collection, feature engineering, and hyperparameter optimization can be considered.
